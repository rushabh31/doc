## Slide 3: The GenAI Evolution Journey
**Title:** Five Stages of GenAI Maturity

### Visual: Staircase diagram showing progression

1. **Simple Prompt-Based Solutions** → Basic Q&A
2. **Simple RAG** → Context-aware responses
3. **Pluggable RAG** → Flexible retrieval strategies
4. **Single AI Agent** → Autonomous task execution
5. **Multi-Agent Systems** → Collaborative intelligence

**Speaker Notes:**
"Think of this as climbing a staircase. Each step builds on the previous one, adding sophistication and capability. We're not replacing what works - we're enhancing it."

---

## Slide 4: Stage 1 - Simple Prompt-Based Solutions
**Title:** Foundation: Prompt Engineering

### What It Is:
- Direct LLM interactions with carefully crafted prompts
- Template-based responses
- Manual context injection

### Capabilities:
- Basic Q&A on policies and procedures
- Simple classification tasks
- Template generation

### Critical Limitations:
- **No access to internal documents** - Can't reference company-specific policies
- **No memory or context retention** - Each interaction starts fresh
- **Static knowledge** - Limited to training data cutoff
- **Inconsistent responses** - Different prompts yield varying quality
- **Manual effort** - Requires prompt engineering for each use case

### Why We Need to Evolve:
→ Need access to our internal knowledge base and documents

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is where most organizations start. While useful for general questions, it can't access our specific policies, procedures, or controls. It's like having a knowledgeable assistant who knows about banking in general but nothing about our specific organization."

---

## Slide 5: Stage 2 - Simple RAG
**Title:** Adding Context: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

### What It Is:
- LLM + Document retrieval system
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Real-time context injection

### Capabilities:
- Answer questions using internal documents
- Policy and procedure lookups
- Basic compliance checks
- Access to current information

### Architecture:
```
User Query → Embedding → Vector Search → Context + LLM → Response
```

### Critical Limitations:
- **One-size-fits-all retrieval** - Same search strategy for all use cases
- **Limited to vector similarity** - Misses keyword-based matches
- **No optimization possible** - Can't tune for specific domains
- **Fixed retrieval logic** - No way to incorporate business rules
- **Performance bottlenecks** - Some queries need different approaches

### Why We Need to Evolve:
→ Different use cases require different retrieval strategies

**Speaker Notes:**
"RAG gives our AI access to internal documents, but it's like having only one way to search. Some queries need exact keyword matches (like policy numbers), while others need semantic understanding. We need flexibility in how we retrieve information."

---

## Slide 6: Stage 3 - Pluggable RAG
**Title:** Flexibility: Modular Retrieval Strategies

### What It Is:
- Configurable retrieval mechanisms
- Strategy pattern implementation
- Hot-swappable components

### Retrieval Options:
- **Standard RAG**: Vector similarity search
- **Hybrid RAG**: Combining keyword + semantic search
- **Agentic RAG**: LLM-driven retrieval decisions
- **Graph RAG**: Knowledge graph traversal

### Key Innovation:
```yaml
# Configuration-driven selection
retrieval_strategy: "hybrid_rag"
parameters:
  semantic_weight: 0.7
  keyword_weight: 0.3
```

### Critical Limitations:
- **Still just Q&A** - Can retrieve information but can't take actions
- **No reasoning capability** - Can't analyze or make decisions
- **No tool integration** - Can't query databases or execute code
- **Single-step process** - No iterative problem solving
- **Human-dependent** - Requires manual interpretation of results

### Why We Need to Evolve:
→ Need AI that can act on information, not just retrieve it

**Speaker Notes:**
"Pluggable RAG gives us flexibility in retrieval, but it's still passive. It's like having a great research assistant who can find any document but can't analyze the data or take any actions based on what they find."

## Slide 7: Stage 4 - Single AI Agent with Tools
**Title:** Autonomy: AI Agents with Specialized Tools

### What It Is:
- Autonomous agents with tool-calling capabilities
- Reasoning and planning abilities
- Self-directed task completion

### Available Tools:
- **Code Interpreter**: Execute and analyze code
- **Text-to-SQL**: Query databases naturally
- **Document Search**: Advanced document analysis
- **API Integrator**: Connect to external systems

### Example Flow:
```
User: "Show me all high-risk EUCs from Q4"
Agent: 1. Converts to SQL query
       2. Executes against database
       3. Analyzes results
       4. Generates summary report
```

### Critical Limitations:
- **Single perspective** - One agent can miss nuances
- **Sequential processing** - Can't parallelize complex tasks
- **Limited expertise** - One agent can't be expert at everything
- **No peer review** - No validation of decisions
- **Bottleneck at scale** - Complex workflows slow down

### Why We Need to Evolve:
→ Complex problems require specialized expertise and collaboration

**Speaker Notes:**
"A single agent with tools is powerful, but it's like having one person do everything. For complex compliance scenarios, we need specialists - one for risk assessment, another for documentation, another for validation. That's where multi-agent systems come in."

---

## Slide 8: Stage 5 - Multi-Agent Systems
**Title:** Collaboration: Orchestrated AI Teams

### What It Is:
- Multiple specialized agents working together
- Inter-agent communication protocols
- Complex workflow orchestration

### Agent Types:
- **Analyst Agent**: Data analysis and insights
- **Compliance Agent**: Regulatory checks
- **Documentation Agent**: Report generation
- **Validation Agent**: Quality assurance

### How It Addresses Previous Limitations:
✓ **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent masters its domain  
✓ **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously  
✓ **Peer Review**: Agents validate each other's work  
✓ **Complex Workflows**: Handle multi-step processes  
✓ **Scalable Architecture**: Add new agents as needed  

### Remaining Considerations:
- **Complexity Management**: Requires careful orchestration
- **Coordination Overhead**: Inter-agent communication needs
- **Governance**: More agents = more oversight needed

**Speaker Notes:**
"Multi-agent systems represent the pinnacle of our evolution. Like a well-coordinated team, each agent brings specialized expertise while collaborating to solve complex problems. This is how we achieve both depth and scale in our control processes."

| **Pluggable RAG → Single Agent** | Can't take actions | Autonomous task execution |
| **Single Agent → Multi-Agent** | Limited to one perspective | Specialized collaboration |

### Key Insight:
**Each evolution isn't replacing the previous - it's building upon it**
- Simple prompts still used for basic queries
- RAG provides the knowledge foundation
- Agents add the ability to act
- Multi-agent brings scale and specialization

**Speaker Notes:**
"Notice how each stage directly addresses the limitations of the previous one. This isn't about throwing away what works - it's about building a comprehensive platform where simpler solutions handle simple problems, and complex solutions are available when needed."
