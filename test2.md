## Slide 4: Stage 1 - Simple Prompt-Based Solutions
**Title:** Foundation: Prompt Engineering

### What It Is:
- Direct LLM interactions with carefully crafted prompts
- Template-based responses
- Manual context injection

### Capabilities:
- Basic Q&A on policies and procedures
- Simple classification tasks
- Template generation
- Issue formatting and structuring

### Complete Example:

**Raw Input:**
```
Subject: urgent - excel report not working in risk dept

Description: Hi IT, the monthly risk calculation spreadsheet that sarah uses every month is giving error messages when she tries to open it. She said it worked fine last week but now when she clicks on the macros its saying "macro disabled" or something like that. This is really important becuase we need to submit risk numbers to regulators by friday and sarah is the only one who knows how to run this report. Also the file seems to be saving to wrong folder now, its going to her desktop instead of the shared drive like before. Can someone please help asap? This might affect our regulatory reporting.

- Filed by: John Smith (Risk Manager)
- Date: March 15, 2024
- Priority: High
```

**Complete Prompt:**
```
You are an enterprise issue management assistant. Transform the following issue description into a structured 4Cs format:
- Concern: What is the main problem?
- Cause: What might be causing this issue?
- Consequence: What are the potential impacts?
- Context: What background information is relevant?

Please ensure the output is professional, clear, and highlights business impacts.

Issue Description: [Raw input above]
```

**Complete Output:**
```
**Concern:** Monthly risk calculation spreadsheet in Risk Department is malfunctioning with macro errors and incorrect file saving location.

**Cause:** 
- Excel macros have been disabled, preventing normal operation
- File path configuration has changed, redirecting saves from shared drive to local desktop

**Consequence:**
- Regulatory reporting deadline (Friday) at risk
- Single point of failure (only Sarah knows the process)
- Potential regulatory compliance violation if reports are delayed

**Context:**
- Critical monthly process for regulatory submission
- Previously functioning system (worked last week)
- Time-sensitive issue with external regulatory deadline
- Knowledge concentration risk identified
```

### Critical Limitations:
- **No access to internal documents** - Can't reference company-specific policies
- **No memory or context retention** - Each interaction starts fresh
- **Static knowledge** - Limited to training data cutoff
- **Inconsistent responses** - Different prompts yield varying quality
- **Manual effort** - Requires prompt engineering for each use case

### Why We Need to Evolve:
→ Need access to our internal knowledge base and documents

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is where most organizations start. While useful for general questions, it can't access our specific policies, procedures, or controls. It's like having a knowledgeable assistant who knows about banking in general but nothing about our specific organization."

## Slide 5: Stage 2 - Simple RAG
**Title:** Adding Context: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

### What It Is:
- LLM + Document retrieval system
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Real-time context injection

### Capabilities:
- Answer questions using internal documents
- Policy and procedure lookups
- Basic compliance checks
- Access to current information

### Architecture:
```
User Query → Embedding → Vector Search → Context + LLM → Response
```

### Complete Example:

**Input:** [Same raw issue description as Stage 1]

**Complete Prompt:**
```
You are an enterprise issue management assistant with access to company policy documents. Transform the following issue description into a structured 4Cs format and include relevant policy references for each section.

Available context from policy documents:
- IT Security Policy 3.2.1: Macro Security Controls - "All Excel macros must be approved via whitelist process"
- Data Management Policy 5.1.3: Shared Drive Requirements - "Business-critical files must be stored on designated shared drives"
- Business Continuity Policy 2.4.1: Critical Process Documentation - "No single person should be sole owner of regulatory processes"
- Risk Management Framework 1.2.5: Monthly Reporting - "Risk calculations must follow standardized procedures"
- Incident Management Policy 4.3.2: Escalation for Regulatory Impact - "Issues affecting regulatory deadlines require immediate VP notification"

Issue Description: [Raw input from Stage 1]

Please structure your response in 4Cs format and cite the relevant policies for each section.
```

**Complete Output:**
```
**Concern:** Monthly risk calculation spreadsheet in Risk Department is malfunctioning with macro errors and incorrect file saving location.
*Reference: IT Security Policy 3.2.1 - Macro Security Controls*

**Cause:** 
- Excel macros have been disabled per IT Security Policy requirements
- File path configuration violates Data Management Policy regarding shared storage
*Reference: Data Management Policy 5.1.3 - Shared Drive Requirements*

**Consequence:**
- Regulatory reporting deadline (Friday) at risk, potential violation of Regulatory Compliance Framework
- Single point of failure violates Business Continuity Policy 2.4.1
- Data integrity risk due to improper file storage location
*Reference: Business Continuity Policy 2.4.1 - Critical Process Documentation*

**Context:**
- Critical monthly process governed by Risk Management Framework 1.2.5
- Escalation required per Incident Management Policy 4.3.2 for regulatory impact
- Issue affects compliance with monthly risk reporting requirements
*Reference: Risk Management Framework 1.2.5, Incident Management Policy 4.3.2*
```

### Critical Limitations:

## Slide 14: Architecture Strategy
**Title:** Modular, Scalable, Plug-and-Play

### Design Principles:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Configuration-Driven**: Changes via config, not code
3. **Standardized Interfaces**: Common protocols for all components
4. **Microservices Architecture**: Independent scaling

### Code Structure:
```python
# Pluggable architecture example
class AIPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.retriever = RetrieverFactory.create(config.retrieval_strategy)
        self.agent = AgentFactory.create(config.agent_type)
        self.tools = ToolRegistry.load(config.enabled_tools)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our architecture is like building with LEGO blocks. Each piece is standardized and interchangeable. Want to change from simple RAG to agentic RAG? Just update the configuration file."
