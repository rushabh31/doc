## Slide 4: Stage 1 - Simple Prompt-Based Solutions
**Title:** Foundation: Prompt Engineering

### What It Is:
- Direct LLM interactions with carefully crafted prompts
- Template-based responses
- Manual context injection

### Capabilities:
- Basic Q&A on policies and procedures
- Simple classification tasks
- Template generation
- Issue formatting and structuring

### Complete Example:

**Raw Input:**
```
Subject: urgent issue - missing apps in controls review

Description: Hey team, we found out during the audit that some applications werent included in our controls review and now we dont know what languages or channels we have for customer facing stuff. The auditors discovered that X application wasnt covered in our control execution and now were worried about what else we might be missing. This could be a big compliance problem and customers might get affected if we dont have proper controls. We need some kind of framework or inventory to track all the customer experience languages and channels better so this doesnt happen again. Not sure how many apps we're missing but this seems like it could be a regulatory issue too.

- Filed by: Sarah Chen (Compliance Manager)  
- Date: March 15, 2024
- Priority: High
```

**Complete Prompt:**
```
You are an enterprise issue management assistant. Transform the following issue description into a structured 4Cs format:
- Concern: What is the main problem?
- Cause: What might be causing this issue?
- Consequence: What are the potential impacts?
- Context: What background information is relevant?

Please ensure the output is professional, clear, and highlights business impacts.

Issue Description: [Raw input above]
```

**Complete Output:**
```
**Concern:** We need a framework to understand what languages and/or channels host internal applications for X's services.

**Cause:** No inventory of customer experience languages and channels exists within X's service for hosted applications.

**Consequence:** Controls may not exist on the entire inventory which may lead to customer impact or regulatory concerns.

**Context:** During the review, it was identified that X application was not included in the control execution. This led to a discovery needed across all channels and languages to ensure that total inventory population is complete.
```

### Critical Limitations:
- **No access to internal documents** - Can't reference specific governance frameworks
- **No memory or context retention** - Each interaction starts fresh
- **Static knowledge** - Limited to training data cutoff
- **Inconsistent responses** - Different prompts yield varying quality
- **Manual effort** - Requires prompt engineering for each use case

### Why We Need to Evolve:
→ Need access to our internal application catalogs, governance policies, and compliance frameworks

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is where most organizations start. While useful for general questions, it can't access our specific application inventories, governance frameworks, or compliance requirements. It's like having a knowledgeable assistant who knows about IT governance in general but nothing about our specific infrastructure."

## Slide 5: Stage 2 - Simple RAG
**Title:** Adding Context: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

### What It Is:
- LLM + Document retrieval system
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Real-time context injection

### Capabilities:
- Answer questions using internal documents
- Policy and procedure lookups
- Basic compliance checks
- Access to current information

### Architecture:
```
User Query → Embedding → Vector Search → Context + LLM → Response
```

### Complete Example:

**Input:** [Same raw issue description as Stage 1]

**Complete Prompt:**
```
You are an enterprise issue management assistant with access to company governance documents. Transform the following issue description into a structured 4Cs format and include relevant policy references for each section.

Available context from governance documents:
- Application Governance Framework 2.1.4: "All customer-facing applications must be registered in the Application Portfolio Management system"
- IT Control Framework 5.3.2: "Control coverage must include 100% of applications handling customer data"
- Compliance Management Policy 3.1.7: "Missing applications in control scope constitute a material control deficiency"
- Enterprise Architecture Standard 4.2.1: "Multi-language applications require separate control assessment per language/channel"
- Risk Management Framework 1.5.3: "Incomplete application inventories create regulatory exposure"
- Audit Management Policy 6.1.4: "Control gaps must be remediated within 90 days of discovery"

Issue Description: [Raw input from Stage 1]

Please structure your response in 4Cs format and cite the relevant policies for each section.
```

**Complete Output:**
```
**Concern:** We need a framework to understand what languages and/or channels host internal applications for X's services.
*Reference: Application Governance Framework 2.1.4 - Application Portfolio Management*

**Cause:** No inventory of customer experience languages and channels exists within X's service for hosted applications.
*Reference: IT Control Framework 5.3.2 - Control Coverage Requirements*

**Consequence:** Controls may not exist on the entire inventory which may lead to customer impact or regulatory concerns.
*Reference: Compliance Management Policy 3.1.7 - Material Control Deficiencies, Risk Management Framework 1.5.3 - Regulatory Exposure*

**Context:** During the review, it was identified that X application was not included in the control execution. This led to a discovery needed across all channels and languages to ensure that total inventory population is complete.
*Reference: Enterprise Architecture Standard 4.2.1 - Multi-language Control Assessment, Audit Management Policy 6.1.4 - Control Gap Remediation*
```

### Critical Limitations:
- **One-size-fits-all retrieval** - Same search strategy for all use cases
- **Limited to vector similarity** - Misses keyword-based matches
- **No optimization possible** - Can't tune for specific domains
- **Fixed retrieval logic** - No way to incorporate business rules
- **Performance bottlenecks** - Some queries need different approaches

### Why We Need to Evolve:
→ Different governance queries require different retrieval strategies

**Speaker Notes:**
"RAG gives our AI access to internal governance documents, but it's like having only one way to search. Some queries need exact framework matches (like specific policy numbers), while others need semantic understanding. We need flexibility in how we retrieve governance information."

## Slide 6: Stage 3 - Pluggable RAG
**Title:** Flexibility: Modular Retrieval Strategies

### What It Is:
- Configurable retrieval mechanisms
- Strategy pattern implementation
- Hot-swappable components

### Retrieval Options:
- **Standard RAG**: Vector similarity search
- **Hybrid RAG**: Combining keyword + semantic search
- **Agentic RAG**: LLM-driven retrieval decisions
- **Graph RAG**: Knowledge graph traversal

### Key Innovation:
```yaml
# Configuration-driven selection
retrieval_strategy: "hybrid_rag"
parameters:
  semantic_weight: 0.7
  keyword_weight: 0.3
```

### Complete Example:

**Input:** [Same raw issue description]

**Configuration:**
```yaml
retrieval_strategy: "hybrid_rag"
issue_type: "application_governance" 
search_weights:
  semantic_search: 0.5
  keyword_search: 0.3
  graph_traversal: 0.2
specialized_retrievers:
  - application_catalog
  - governance_frameworks
  - audit_findings
  - architecture_docs
```

**Complete Prompt:**
```
You are an enterprise issue management assistant with access to multiple specialized retrieval systems. Analyze the following issue using hybrid search strategies optimized for application governance scenarios.

Retrieved Context (Hybrid Search Results):
- Application Portfolio Database: 847 registered applications, 23 identified as customer-facing with multi-language support
- Architecture Review AR-2024-Q1: "Application X identified as Angular/React hybrid with 5 language variants (EN, ES, FR, DE, PT)"
- Previous Audit Finding AF-2023-012: "Similar control gap discovered in Payment Services - 12 applications missed in control scope"
- Enterprise Architecture Catalog: "Customer Experience applications span 15 different technology stacks and 8 cloud environments"
- Governance Framework Update GF-2024-02: "New requirement: Multi-channel applications need per-channel control assessment"
- Control Execution Log: "X application last assessed 18 months ago, multi-language variants never included"

Issue Description: [Raw input]

Provide 4Cs analysis with specific references, similar case patterns, and recommended actions.
```

**Complete Output:**
```
**Concern:** We need a framework to understand what languages and/or channels host internal applications for X's services.

**Cause:** No inventory of customer experience languages and channels exists within X's service for hosted applications.
*Sources: Application Portfolio Database gap analysis, Architecture Review AR-2024-Q1*

**Consequence:** Controls may not exist on the entire inventory which may lead to customer impact or regulatory concerns.
*Sources: Previous Audit Finding AF-2023-012 (similar impact in Payment Services), Governance Framework Update GF-2024-02*

**Context:** During the review, it was identified that X application was not included in the control execution. This led to a discovery needed across all channels and languages to ensure that total inventory population is complete.
*Sources: Control Execution Log (18-month gap), Enterprise Architecture Catalog (15 tech stacks, 8 environments)*

**Enhanced Analysis:**
- **Pattern Identified**: Similar to AF-2023-012 where Payment Services missed 12 applications
- **Scope Estimate**: 847 total applications in portfolio, 23 customer-facing with multi-language variants
- **Technical Complexity**: X application has 5 language variants across Angular/React hybrid architecture
- **Governance Gap**: Multi-channel applications require separate per-channel assessments per GF-2024-02

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate**: Conduct comprehensive scan of all customer-facing applications in portfolio
2. **Short-term**: Implement automated discovery for multi-language/channel variants
3. **Long-term**: Establish ongoing governance framework for application inventory management
```

### Critical Limitations:
- **Still just Q&A** - Can retrieve information but can't take actions
- **No reasoning capability** - Can't analyze or make decisions
- **No tool integration** - Can't query databases or execute code
- **Single-step process** - No iterative problem solving
- **Human-dependent** - Requires manual interpretation of results

### Why We Need to Evolve:
→ Need AI that can act on information, not just retrieve it

**Speaker Notes:**
"Pluggable RAG gives us flexibility in retrieval, but it's still passive. It's like having a great research assistant who can find any document about our applications but can't actually scan our infrastructure or take any actions based on what they find."

2. **Configuration-Driven**: Changes via config, not code
3. **Standardized Interfaces**: Common protocols for all components
4. **Microservices Architecture**: Independent scaling

### Code Structure:
```python
# Pluggable architecture example
class AIPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.retriever = RetrieverFactory.create(config.retrieval_strategy)
        self.agent = AgentFactory.create(config.agent_type)
        self.tools = ToolRegistry.load(config.enabled_tools)
```
